Q4. Explain the stepwise working of innovation explaining all components?



Ans.



1. Shelf-Mounted Barcode Scanners are installed on each shelf within a retail store. They are equipped with barcode scanners that can read product barcodes. The scanners are connected to a central system, which can be cloud-based or in-store, and are capable of instantly identifying the products on the shelves.



2. Each customer is issued a unique customer card with its own barcode. This card is registered in the retail store's system and will be used by customer for adding products.



3. When a customer enters the store, they pick up a customer card and start shopping. To add products to their shopping cart, the customer first scans their unique card with the mounted barcode scanner.



4. As the customer selects products, they scan the barcode of each item using the shelf-mounted barcode scanner. The scanner sends the product information to the central system, where it is added to the card customer was given at the entrance.



5. The central system keeps track of the items added to the customer's card in real-time. It calculates the total cost and provides the customer with a running tally of amount added to their card.



6. Security Measures: Security features, such as AI based surveillance cameras, are in place to prevent theft and ensure the accuracy of billing.



7. When the customer is ready to complete their shopping, they proceed to the retail payment counter. At this point, they simply scan their unique customer card, which transfers all the items from their virtual cart to the payment terminal.



8. The payment terminal calculates the total cost of the items based on the scanned data and the customer's card. The customer makes the payment using their preferred payment method (credit card, cash, mobile wallet, etc.).



9. Upon successful payment, the customer receives a digital or printed receipt, and their shopping session is concluded. They can exit the store with their purchased items.



The innovation streamlines the retail shopping process by automating the checkout process and providing customers with a convenient and efficient shopping experience. It enhances inventory management, reduces human errors in billing, and fosters customer loyalty through personalized recommendations. Additionally, the system offers security against theft and fraud and promotes a more convenient and adaptable shopping experience.
